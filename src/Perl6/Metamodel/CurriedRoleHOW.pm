# Sometimes, we see references to roles that provide parameters but
# do not fully resolve them. For example, in:
# 
#   class C does R[T] { }
#
# We need to represent R[T], but we cannot yet fully specialize the
# role because we don't have the first parameter to hand. We may also
# run into the issue where we have things like:
# 
#   sub foo(R[T] $x) { ... }
#   if $x ~~ R[T] { ... }
# 
# Where we clearly want to talk about a partial parameterization of a
# role and actually want to do so in a way distinct from a particular
# instantiation of it. This meta-object represents those "partial types"
# as both a way to curry on your way to a full specialization, but also
# as a way to do type-checking or punning.
